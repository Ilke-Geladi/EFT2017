<p>Diversity Profiles show that tree diversity is more neutrally diverse in Paracou than in BCI, as the Paracou curve is above the the BCI curve. It can further be said that BCI and Paracou are separable as the communities diversity profiles do not intersect<span class="citation"><sup>15</sup></span>. There has been much debate as to which diversity indices to use as there exist many. However, diversity profiles play an important role in converging these indices by portraying them graphically as the value of diversity is plotted in function to the order q, which represent different indices<span class="citation"><sup>15,18</sup></span>. The raw result of the Hill numbers calculated support the above conclusion that Paracou is more diverse than BCI. Hill numbers provide many advantages over other frequent used measures of diversity, such as species richness, through incorporating both relative abundance and species richness, amongst other reasons<span class="citation"><sup>19</sup></span>. Overall, diversity profiles and Hill numbers, which are two more reliable methods of calculating diversity, reveal that Paracou has a higher tree diversity than BCI.</p>
<p>Rarefaction results support the conclusions from the diversity profiles, taking it a step further and revealing the tree diversity in Paracou is almost double that of BCI (when q=0 and q=2). Rarefaction of the data is important as it standardizes the data on the basis of sample size or sample completeness thus facilitating and providing a more accurate view of the comparison between both forest plots<span class="citation"><sup>19</sup></span>. Having both diversity profiles and rarefied data support that Paracou is more diverse than BCI, we can be certain of this conclusion.</p>
<p>A logical explanation as to why Paracou is more diverse than BCI is related to island biogeography theory where it predicts that with increased colonization, there is more diversity<span class="citation"><sup>10</sup></span>. Seeing as Paracou is on continental land, it is very connected to other communities where colonization is facilitated compared to BCI which is an island. Furthermore, island populations have a much higher risk of extinction than mainland populations<span class="citation"><sup>20</sup></span>. However, it must also be recognized that often islands have higher speciation rates and thus more endemic species, being valuable in a different way than mainland ecosystems, which is not taken into account by these calculations<span class="citation"><sup>21</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Studying diversity is very important in ecological theory and practice<span class="citation"><sup>18</sup></span>. Diversity indices are often used as indicators of the ‘well-being’ of an ecosystem and are thus implicated in conservation management and environmental monitoring<span class="citation"><sup>18,19</sup></span>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Paracou is more diverse than BCI. Studying diversity is important as it informs us about the state of the ecosystem, and has implications in management strategies. Eventhough BCI has the advantage of being very well-studied and potentially having more endemic species than Paracou, Paracou has a higher diversity than BCI which can provide very interesting research opportunities compared to BCI.</p>
